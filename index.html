				<p>I'm a random teenage high schooler with an active imagination. I'm also a gaming geek who wishes to design them in the future. I always think the craziest of things and like to share them with others. I am know to be a good writer and storyteller. In time, I hope to find the way to put fantasy into reality. </p>
